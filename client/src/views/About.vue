        <p>The goal of this project is to provide a tool that simplifies the process of creating finite
            automata graphs for students and teachers. This application addresses the need for an interactive,
            user-friendly platform where users can design and customize graphs through a drag-and-drop interface. By
            enabling the generation of XML and LaTeX code directly from the created graphs, the application
            streamlines the workflow for users who need to incorporate these graphs in academic settings, reducing the
            time required for such tasks. The tool is designed to enhance the educational experience by making
            graph creation more accessible and efficient.</p>
