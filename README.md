# Projects-Fall-2024
This repository will serve as a workspace for my project during the Fall 2024 Semester.

# Project Proposal
We are proposing the development of a full-stack web application designed as a versatile
graph generator, suitable for creating various types of graphs ( non-finite automata, deterministic
finite automata, etc.) This application will incorporate a drag-and-drop interface that enables
users to interactively construct and customize graphs by manipulating nodes, edges, and loops.
For the development of this project, we plan to utilize a technology stack that includes Vue.js for
the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and SQL for database management. The app will include
several key features, including the ability for users to save their graphs in PNG or JPG format,
and to generate LaTeX code corresponding to each graph, using Python to convert from the
image to LaTex.

# Business Context
The business context for this project is to provide a tool that simplifies the process of creating finite automata graphs for students and teachers. This web application will address the need for an interactive, user-friendly platform where users can design and customize graphs through a drag-and-drop interface. By enabling the generation of XML and LaTeX code directly from the created graphs, the application will streamline the workflow for users who need to incorporate these graphs in academic settings, reducing the time required for such tasks. The tool will be designed to enhance the educational experience by making graph creation more accessible and efficient.

#Roadmap and Weekly Progress

## Week 1
[ ] Draw out basic design for website including ALL desired features (tentative outline)
  - [ ] Webpage with drag and drop graphs using HTML/CSS/Javascript/Typescript
  - [ ] Give users the ability to save their graphs as files (Unsure of what library will be used for this yet).
  - [ ] Allow users to login to website using Google API
  - [ ] Allow users to create unique accounts for website and save their files using SQL Database.
  - [x] Let users save their graphs as XML code as opposed to image (using python)
  - [ ] Let users save their graphs as TIKZ/Latex code (using python)
[] Write up first features to implement and how they will be implemented
 - [] Webpage with drag and drop graphs
 - [] Give users the ability to save their graphs as files
